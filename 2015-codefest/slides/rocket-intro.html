Unfortunately, a simple re-usable component is not how things are playing out. Docker now is building tools for
launching cloud servers, systems for clustering, and a wide range of functions: building images, running images,
uploading, downloading, and eventually even overlay networking, all compiled into one monolithic binary running
primarily as root on your server. The standard container manifesto was removed. We should stop talking about Docker
containers, and start talking about the Docker Platform. It is not becoming the simple composable building block we had
envisioned.
